Free GUS API to retrieve corporate data from the Central Statistical Office (GUS) in Poland.

== Description ==

Plug-in nip24.pl is designed for all of the WooCommerce platform users. It dynamically downloads data which is needed to place an order and is necessary to prepare an invoice. The user can do it within seconds thanks to entering Tax Identification Number (NIP) which allows the system automatically quickly fills in required form fields. Portal nip24.pl currently contains information about more than 3.7 million companies  which are registered in Poland.
This plug-in not only supports filling out the online form at the FrontEnd, it also manages some additional features at the BackOffice:
* It gives the user opportunity to verify whether the company which is placing the order exists, did not suspend the business or did not end the business.
* It enables the user to generate and transmit fiscal documents such as e-invoice and e-receipt.
